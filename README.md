<h1> ASP.NET Core Web API that uses Entity Framework </h1>

I wanted to explore ASP.NET Core and Object Oriented Programming in more detail, so followed a tutorial to build a Web API in ASP.NET Core.

This API features:\n
\n-MVC Architecture
\n-Sorting and Pagination
\n-JSON Webtokens
\n-Role-based authentication
