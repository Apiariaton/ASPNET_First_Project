<h1> ASP.NET Core Web API that uses Entity Framework </h1>

I wanted to explore ASP.NET Core and Object Oriented Programming in more detail, so followed a tutorial to build a Web API in ASP.NET Core.

This API features:
-MVC Architecture
-Sorting and Pagination
-JSON Webtokens
-Role-based authentication
