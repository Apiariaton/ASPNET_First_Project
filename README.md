<h1> ASP.NET Core Web API that uses Entity Framework </h1>

<b> Web API which explores New Zealand Walks. </b>

I wanted to explore ASP.NET Core and Object Oriented Programming in more detail, so followed a tutorial to build a Web API in ASP.NET Core.

This API features:<br>
<br>-MVC Architecture
<br>-Sorting and Pagination
<br>-JSON Webtokens
<br>-Role-based authentication
